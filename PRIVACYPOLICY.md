# Privacy Policy of Msync

Msync is an open source app to sync your Meetup events into your Android calendar. You can look into it to see what it does at https://github.com/the4thfloor/msync

## What information do we collect?

This app was build to sync your Meetup events into your Android calendar. To do this you need to log in with your Meetp account. Your login informations are directly transmitted over a secure connection to Meetup.

During this login we get some basic profil informations about you from Meetup. We use your full name to identify the calendar entries as your Meetup events.
We also get a access token to access the Meetup server on your behalf. We use Androids AccountManager to store this token at a secure place of your Android device.

We never store your Meetup credentials on your device or somewhere else.

During the usage of this app we collect some usage statistics. This might include your device information, length of visit, number of page views, your approximate location, and similar behavioural information. This information may be collected by a third party analytics provider or debugging provider on our behalf such as Google Play Store, Firebase Analytics and/or Firebase Crash Reporting.

We don't have our own backend server so we don't have your data in our own hands.

## How to delete your stored data
To delete your stored data just delete this app. We don't have our own backend server so we don't have your data in our own hands.
